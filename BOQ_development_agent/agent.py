You will receive JSON inputs from seven structured extraction agents:
- component_geometry
- pile_details
- reinforcement_details
- material_specs
- seismic_arrestors
- structural_notes
- compliance_parameters

Each agent returns structured data about different aspects of a bridge construction project extracted from a PDF. Your task is to intelligently combine and transform these inputs into a unified and organized Bill of Quantities (BoQ).

For each relevant item, output:
- `component`: Name/type of the element (e.g., Pier P1, Deck Slab)
- `material`: Material used (e.g., Concrete M35, Fe500D TMT Bars)
- `quantity`: Value + unit (e.g., 850 kg, 18.2 m³)
- `specification`: Related codes/specs (e.g., IS 456, bar spacing, concrete cover)
- `category`: Logical grouping (e.g., Superstructure, Substructure, Reinforcement)

Use the following logic:
- Use data from `component_geometry`, `pile_details`, and `reinforcement_details` to identify measurable quantities.
- Use `material_specs` and `compliance_parameters` to extract and cross-check material grades and applicable codes.
- Use `structural_notes` to support assumptions, load considerations, or categorization.
- Use `seismic_arrestors` where they appear as physical or regulatory components.
- Group items logically and keep similar categories together.

Return the BoQ in this format:
{
  "boq": [
    {
      "component": "Pier P1",
      "material": "Concrete M35",
      "quantity": "18.2 m³",
      "specification": "IS 456, 50mm cover",
      "category": "Substructure"
    },
    {
      "component": "Deck Slab",
      "material": "Fe500D TMT Bars",
      "quantity": "850 kg",
      "specification": "Top 4T16 @150mm, Bottom 2T12 @200mm",
      "category": "Reinforcement"
    }
  ]
}

Notes:
- Omit empty or irrelevant entries.
- If a field is unavailable, mark its value as "incomplete".
- Ensure units are consistent (e.g., kg, m³, m²).
- Prepare this BoQ as if it will be directly exported to PDF.

    model="gemini-2.5-pro",
    description="Validates the generated Bill of Quantities (BoQ) by checking completeness, consistency, unit accuracy, and code compliance.",
    instruction="""
    You will receive a structured Bill of Quantities (BoQ) JSON that was generated from seven extraction agents.

    Your task is to validate the following:

    1. Completeness:
    - Are all major sections (component geometry, pile details, reinforcement, material specs, seismic elements, structural notes, and compliance) represented in the BoQ?

    2. Quantity Accuracy:
    - Are units provided for each quantity?
    - Are numeric values meaningful (not zero, empty, or marked as "incomplete")?

    3. Specification Coverage:
    - Do items mention specifications (e.g., bar spacing, concrete grade)?
    - Are relevant codes included (e.g., IS 456, IS 2911, IRC 83)?

    4. Category Distribution:
    - Are items grouped under logical categories like Superstructure, Substructure, Reinforcement, etc.?

    5. Format and Syntax:
    - Is the JSON response well-formed?
    - Are fields like `component`, `material`, `quantity`, `specification`, and `category` present for each item?

    Also ensure:
    - If the term `"incomplete"` appears in any field, flag it.
    - If any required sections (e.g., Reinforcement, Piles) are missing or underpopulated, include that in the `issues`.
    - Units should be standardized (kg, m³, m², etc.) and match the type of material.

    Return one of the following responses:

    If BoQ is valid:
    {
    "validation": "pass",
    "issues": []
    }

    If BoQ is invalid:
    {
    "validation": "fail",
    "issues": [
        "Missing reinforcement quantity for Pier P1",
        "Incomplete material specification for Deck Slab",
        "Category 'Substructure' is missing",
        "Quantity format invalid: '850'"
    ]
    }

    Be specific in your feedback so the BoQ can be regenerated correctly if needed.
